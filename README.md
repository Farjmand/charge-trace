# charge-trace
An app that allows users to track their EV batteries schedule

clone this project
Then `cd charge-trace`
Then in one terminal add `cd frontend`
and in the other terminal add `cd backend`
and you will have the project running.

# APIS
Currently the project has:
1. User Registration API
2. Sign In APIs alongwith the Admin `Jeff `
3. Get All Vehicles List API
4. Get All Vehicles according to a specific user API
5. Add  new Vehicle API
6. Logout API

# FrontEnd
On the frontend we have:
1. Registration Form
2. Login Form
3. A dashboard where the current user's cars are displayed alognwith their charging start and end time
4. A form for adding new vehicles (API not working ... )
5. A chart with hourly electric prices for 7 days so that the user can see the highs and lows of prices to select a `Smart Schedule `

# Scope
Currently everything is manual. User can set their own time schedules for their car charging. But this can get more improved and with enhanced features. 
We can generate a smart schedule for users by checking the electric prices or they can set a manual schedule by themselves.
They can also set their home addresses for their cars charging to be started and stopped automatically. We can also check battery timings, batter usage and performanaces of the cars based on this data.
